# Social Media Dashboard

## Overview

The **Social Media Dashboard** is a hands-on project that demonstrates the development of a fully functional web application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. This project incorporates essential components such as **user authentication**, **API development**, **frontend integration**, and **data persistence**.

The application enables users to register, log in, create posts, update or delete posts, and manage sessions securely. Designed for scalability and security, the project also includes deployment through **Docker** for consistent environments.

---

## Features

- **User Management**: User registration and authentication using JWT tokens.
- **Post Management**: Create, edit, delete, and paginate posts.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Frontend Dashboard**: A responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Docker Deployment**: Simplified deployment with containerized environments.

---

## Technologies Used

### 1. **Backend**
- **Node.js & Express**:  
  Manages server-side logic, routing, and middleware for API endpoints.  
  Example: `app.post('/register')` handles user registration and creates a JWT token.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**:  
  Used for secure user authentication and maintaining session state.  
  Example: `authenticateJWT` middleware validates tokens for protected routes.

- **Session Management**:  
  `express-session` stores JWT tokens for persistent user authentication.

- **Mongoose**:  
  Provides schema-based validation and interaction with MongoDB.  
  Example: The `User` and `Post` schemas manage user and post data.

---

### 2. **Frontend**
- **HTML & CSS**:  
  - Creates a clean and responsive user interface for interactions like registration, login, and post management.
  - Includes dynamic elements like pagination and session-based controls.

- **JavaScript**:  
  - Handles dynamic features such as post creation, editing, deletion, and pagination without requiring page reloads.

---

### 3. **Database**
- **MongoDB**:  
  - Stores user credentials and post data using schema validation.
  - Collections:
    - **Users**: Fields include `username`, `email`, and `password`.
    - **Posts**: Fields include `userId` (relation to Users) and `text`.

---

### 4. **Authentication**
- **JWT Authentication**:  
  - Protects API routes by validating tokens before granting access.
  - Middleware examples:
    - `authenticateJWT`: Ensures API requests are from authenticated users.
    - `requireAuth`: Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

---

### 5. **Deployment**
- **Docker**:  
  - Containerizes the application for consistent deployment.
  - The `Dockerfile` defines the applicationâ€™s Node.js environment, dependencies, and execution.
  - Example:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:18.12.1-bullseye-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN npm install
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD ["node", "app.js"]
    ```

- **Docker Compose**:  
  - Manages multi-container setups for the Node.js app and MongoDB.
  - Example `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    services:
      mongodb:
        image: mongo
        ports:
          - "27017:27017"
      app:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
          - mongodb
    ```

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 18 or later)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud-based)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/social-media-dashboard.git
   cd social-media-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Update the MongoDB URI in `app.js` if running locally:
   ```javascript
   const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
   mongoose.connect(uri, { dbName: 'SocialDB' });
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000`.

6. To deploy using Docker:
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build . -t socialapp
     ```
   - Start services:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**:  
  Passwords are encrypted, and JWT tokens are generated and validated for each session.

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Create**: Add new posts.
  - **Read**: View posts with pagination.
  - **Update**: Modify existing posts.
  - **Delete**: Remove posts.

- **Frontend Interactions**:  
  - Dynamic buttons and forms adjust based on the user's authentication state.
